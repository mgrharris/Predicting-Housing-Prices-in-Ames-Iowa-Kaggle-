# Predicting-Housing-Prices-in-Ames-Iowa-Kaggle-
In this group project, our team entered an Active Kaggle competition to predict the pricing of houses in Ames, Iowa. We were provided with a dataset on which to train, and a test dataset, on which our model would be validated. 

Our team performed Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, and applied Variable Transformations when necessary. We tested various Machine-Learning models in our Cross-Validation phase to determine the best model at predicting house prices. Our team tested Linear Models, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost Models. Our best-performing model was a forecast combination of our Elastic Net and XGBoost model. Using this retained model, our team submitted our prediction results to Kaggle. Our submission finished in the top 8% for competing teams in this active competition.
